In this week I have learnt the basics of Python.I have learned about Python First Program, comments, variables, Arithmetic operations, Indentation, Data Types, Lists and tuples.
What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language.
It is used for:
•	Web development (server-side),
•	Software development,
•	Mathematics, 
•	System scripting.

Python First Program:-
Suppose we want to print “Hello World” program in Python, we can do this using one statement.  
print("Hello world")

Python Comments:-
# This is a single line comment.

'''This is a 
multiline comment
'''

Python Variables:-
Variables are containers for storing data values.
sttr = "This is me"
age = 21
weight = 75.5

Arithmetic operations:-
print("The value of 3 + 5 = ", 3+5)
print("The value of 3 - 5 = ", 3-5)
print("The value of 3 * 5 = ", 3*5)
print("The value of 3 / 5 = ", 3/5)
print("The value of 3 ** 5 = ", 3**5)
print("The value of 3 // 5 = ", 3//5)

Python Indentation:-
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Python use indentation to indicate a block of code.
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")

Python Data Types:-
Python has many data types like str, int, float, complex, list, tuple etc.
#getting the data type
x = 5
print(type(x))

Python Lists:-
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# Lists
colleges = ['IIT', 'NIT', 'College of engineering']
print(colleges[2])

Python tuples:-
Tuples are also used to store multiple items in a single variable but it is unchangeable.
# Tuples
tup1 = (1, 2, 3)
list1 = list(tup1)
print(list1)
print(tup1[0])
