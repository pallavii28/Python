In this week I have learnt about Python Dictionary, If Else & Elif Conditionals In Python, Short hand if else, Functions, Loops and Exception Handing.
Python Dictionary:
“Python dictionary is an unordered collection of items. Each item of the dictionary has a key and value pair/ key-value pair.”

d2 = {"Purnima":"Burger",
      "Rohan":"Fish",
      "Pallavi":"Roti",
      "Shubham":{"B":"maggie", "L":"roti", "D":"Chicken"}}

If Else & Elif Conditionals In Python:
“If, else and elif statement can be defined as a multiway decision taken by our program due to the certain conditions in our code.”

print("What is your age?")
age = int(input())
if age<18:
    print("You cannot drive")

elif age==18:
    print("We will think about you")

else:
    print("You can drive")

# Short hand if else
print("What is your age?")
age = int(input())
print("You can drive") if(age>18) else print("You cannot drive")


 
Python supports many sorts of shorthand statements and with the help of these statements, we can write our code in a more compact sort or form using less space.

Functions in Python:
 “Functions in Python can be defined as lines of codes that are built to create a specific task and can be used again and again in a program when called.”

There are two types of functions in the Python language:
•	Built-in functions
•	User-defined functions

# a = 9
# b = 8
# c = sum((a, b)) # built in function

def function2(a, b):
    """This is a function which will calculate average of two numbers
    this function doesnt work for three numbers"""
    average = (a+b)/2
    return average

v = function2(5, 7)
print(v)
print(function2.__doc__)

 
Loops In Python:
 
# For loop
list1 = [ ["Pallavi", 1], ["Purnima", 2],
          ["Priyal", 6], ["Riya", 250]]
dict1 = dict(list1)
for item in dict1:
    print(item)

# While loop
while(True):
    inp = int(input("Enter a Number\n"))
    if inp>100:
        print("Congrats you have entered a number greater than 100\n")
        break
    else:
        print("Try again!\n")
        continue

Exception Handing in Python:

print("Enter num 1")
num1 = input()
print("Enter num 2")
num2 = input()
try:
    print("The sum of these two numbers is",
          int(num1)+int(num2))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

print("Hello!!")
